Cyber Security Fundamentals Notes
=================================

Introduction
------------

> - CSF Notes, written to read like an abreviated/simplified Student Guide.  
   I try to rewrite some things in layman's terms, but IT and the DoD is a deadly combo; sometimes trying to rewrite the acronym soup they whip up is like trying to unscramble an egg.
   
   

> - Editing this File
>   - If you'd like to download and edit this file to help with note-taking, it's written in Markdown, which is a document formatting language.  
      It may look intimidating if you're not familiar with coding or markup note-taking, but it's actually pretty easy, and you'll be able to spot how the raw file relates to the formatted view pretty quickly.  
      If you're interested, [this cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) has all the syntax listed in an easy-to-search format.

> - **Footstomps**
>   - **Bold** items are footstomped notes.
>       - If reading the raw .md file, **Bold** items have \*\*Double Asterisks\*\*.
>   - Footstomped notes may be a definition or the entire item. If I only marked the term, it's probably the latter.

> - \$\$\$
>   - Lines marked with '$' are incomplete notes.
>   - If you're taking notes in Markdown (like editing this file), don't repeat \$s without putting a \\backslash before each one or you'll get a parsing error.
